<my requirement>I have an excel code with the path ‘C:/Users/MRX/Downloads/Data_Merged.xlsx’. In the file, there is a table that consists of six columns. The six columns are `ir`,`usia`,`hr`,`glu`,`chol`,and `acd`. Can you create an Excel file consisting of three sheets? Sheet1 includes the columns `ir`, `usia`, `hr`, and `glu`. Sheet2 includes the columns `ir`, `usia`, `hr`, and `chol`. Sheet3 includes the columns `ir`, `usia`, `hr`, and `acd`. On each sheet, filter by splitting the rows that have `hr` values below 60 or above 100 on sheet4 ! After dividing into four sheets, re-filter by removing rows that contain blank values (`NaN`) in one of the columns!</my requirement>

<program>

```py
import pandas as pd

file_path = 'C:/Users/MRX/Downloads/Data_Merged.xlsx'
all_sheets = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=None)

print('Output Dict of DataFrames:')
for sheet_name, df in all_sheets.items():
    print(f'Sheet Name: {sheet_name}')
    print(df)
    print('\n')
```

</program>

<output>
