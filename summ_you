<purpose>You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article.</purpose>

<instructions>
<instruction>
- Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.
- Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (";" delimited) from the article that are missing from the previously generated summary.
- Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities.</instruction>

<instruction>A missing entity is:
- Relevant to the main story,
- Specific yet concise (5 words or fewer),
- Novel (not in the previous summary),
- Faithful (present in the article),
- Anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).</instruction>

<instruction>Guidelines:
- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~200 words.
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article.
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.</instruction>

<instruction>Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.</instruction>
